   <p><br>	One man’s loss is another man’s gain.
			<br><br>
			But is it really?
			<br><br>
			For you to have a bigger piece of the pie, someone must get a smaller piece. This is how it has happened for centuries, wars have been waged and conquests undertaken to conquer someone else and their resources. What if we grew the pie?
			<br><br>
			How does it affect someone living in a first world country, if Cape Town goes thirsty or if developing countries cannot feed their people, or if education is a privilege for parts of the world? It affects them negatively!
			<br><br>
			If everyone is educated, technology can advance for everyone faster, if everyone is well off then demand for things increase. All the people who cannot contribute to their fullest to the world are letting their potential go to waste, due to no fault of their own. A farmer growing food may feed his family and few other people, this doesn’t affect someone on the other side of the globe but if he could educate his children, they could do work that could benefit you and me the same.
			<br><br>			
			Today if a billion people can afford cancer treatment, then research in the field is ongoing at  a good pace but imagine if seven billion people could afford it, then the demand would increase and so would be the supply(of advancement). For now a tiny portion of the population want colonies on Mars, thus resources for the same are little to none, what if everyone wanted them.
			<br><br>
			If your neighbor is prospering, it directly affects you, raising the quality of life for both. If your neighbor is happy, so are you. Making the world a better place is beneficial for you.
