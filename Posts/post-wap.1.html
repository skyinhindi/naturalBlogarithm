   <p>( Disclaimer: Think about what you read ahead, but take it as it is, a train of thought. The following is a collection of many 
   thoughts I have had over the years, thus excuse me if my flow is a bit off. I have raised more questions than I have given answers 
   below, for the answers have not yet been decided. Most of all enjoy with your curiosity by your side. )
   <br><br>
The most basic goal of any species is to survive. It is the only goal. Yet Humans seem to disagree, or maybe we are just unaware. When
 I speak of survival, I ask you to look at a grander scale, there are seven billion humans and obviously we aren’t an endangered species,
 but will we survive for another hundred years? Will we survive past this millennium? Will we survive ourselves?
 <br><br>
We tend to live our lives on a very small scale, only looking at ourselves, our community or maybe the world. This truly is a small scale
 when we look at the entirety of the cosmos. All of humanity isn’t even a speck of dust when compared to the universe and the time we have
 lived is nothing but a passing second to it. Can we survive time?
 <br><br>
Imagine our species to be a living entity, maybe it is, will it survive if each organ wants all the blood and oxygen and energy for itself,
 leaving the rest to perish? What if each cell only works for its own survival not caring if the rest die? We think only of self, some of 
 community and some of country. How many think for the world, for all of humanity? Why do we want a wall when we need a bridge, missiles 
 when we need rockets? Why are we moving towards destruction, when we need to embrace creation?
<br><br> 
Humanity first emerged, evolved, got curious, innovated, embraced then stopped. Our own social institutions and society is a hurdle towards
 progress, towards our survival. We have gotten comfortable with where we have reached and now all our energy and resources go towards just
 fulfilling unnecessary things we do not need. We work for that which is killing us, we are destroying the planet. This isn’t an opinion, 
 it’s fact. 
 <br><br>
 I wonder at times why each and every one of us isn’t working towards advancing our species? We compete with each other unnecessarily, 
 only wasting time we don’t have. We have the capability to reach phases of humanity far beyond imagination and if we fail, it won’t matter
 in a few centuries. Currently we are almost a “type one civilization”, meaning we can almost harness all the energy on our planet, what if
 we could harness all that the galaxy has to offer. It may seem I ask everyone to leave everything and put all effort on scientific
 advancement, but that isn’t the case, I ask that we put all scientific efforts towards positive advancement which will carry humanity
 forward, all political efforts towards uniting the world instead of dividing it, all artistic efforts towards preserving the “humanity”
 of humans and all human efforts towards the survival of the species.
<br><br>
We currently possess the tools that can wipe out humans off the face of the Earth and scar it beyond recognition, I don’t really mean
 nuclear weapons, I talk of dangerous minds, narrow minds of certain people who do not see the world as it it and people as one. These
 trigger happy fools reserve the power to destroy, power that should be taken away. 
 <br><br>
I earlier talked about the larger scale, the world compared to the rest of creation, is our species truly safe as long as we are on the
 planet? One cosmic event could annihilate us, don’t believe me,  ask the dinosaurs or others from the earlier five major extinction events,
 together which contributed towards the extinction of over 75% of all species to have ever existed on Earth. We are currently going through 
 a sixth extinction event called the Holocene extinction, which has thus far suffered the loss of over a thousand species, mostly due to 
 human activity. Will we also be a victim? This truly shows the value of going to mars, going beyond the solar system making the species
 not only multi-planetary but also multi-solar. We won’t live forever, but surviving means living as long as you can, the rest only time
 will tell.
 <br><br>
Looking at the grand scale of the universe, I often get sad that we will never explore all of it, the farthest we can ever reach is the
 extent of the “Local Group”, but can we even reach that far, can we even reach beyond our pettiness and the small scale we think on, 
 live on?
 <br><br>
So have we failed as a species?
<br><br>
Not yet.....
