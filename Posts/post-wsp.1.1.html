   <p><br><br>Her smile was his strength. Her death, his misery. He remembered when he first saw her,
   his world stopped. She gave his life a new meaning. She gave him a purpose and that was to make her happy, to make her 
   laugh, to make her sing and dance with joy. Before her, his life was a moonless night with only some points of light and 
   reason. One being his beloved wife Mariam who died giving birth to this angel. He remembered his sorrow on hearing that
   his wife had died, followed by the pang of hatred that grew towards the child. But when he saw her lying next to his 
   motionless Mariam, he thought it was his own Mariam, only this time in the form of a little angel. The junior Mariam was like
   a meteor which had shot across his night sky. And now with her gone, everything went black again. The meteor had fallen over
   the horizon. The epidemic took her away. He was left heartbroken once again and there was no more reason for anything.
