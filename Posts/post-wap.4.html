   <p><br>	
	As we grow older we get more and more isolated, lesser friends, lesser people around us. In this situation we begin to value 
	those around us greatly. Galaxies are no different.
   <br><br>
	As the universe expands, we move away from the rest of existence. A very popular example is of a balloon with marked points on it, 
	as the balloon expands, the points move further from each other. Soon there will be a time when things are so far away that all we 
	can do is gaze into the beyond, only to be greeted by darkness. Milkdromeda (resultant galaxy after the merging of the Milky Way and 
	Andromeda) will be all alone. 
	<br><br>
	If all our knowledge is lost, future civilizations may believe that the galaxy is the entire universe.
	<br><br>
	Assuming and hoping humanity survives that long, we will at a point exhaust all the energy from our sun and all other stars in 
	the galaxy and when the last star dies, it will be lights out for us.
	<br><br>
	All of this will not happen for billions of years. The reason I have painted this image of cosmic isolation is to try and give being
	alone a bigger meaning so that one may realize that the light shines for today and it will for a thousand tomorrows, we are not alone,
	no one is, so just flick the switch and let there be light.
