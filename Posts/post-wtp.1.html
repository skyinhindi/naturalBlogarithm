   <p> She got to know about the news as it spread
<br>
And cried and cried till her eyes were all red
<br>
She was left in complete shock,
<br>
For she never knew that he would no more talk. 
<br>
His problems why could no one cure?
<br>
Two months of pain he tolerated what for?
<br>
When he was not to meet her back
<br>
And all colours for her changed forever to black.
<br><br>
Even though he lay on that bed for long ,
<br>
It  always felt he was the same sturdy and strong
<br>
Who knew he was close to the end?
<br>
And that she was about to lose her intimate friend?
<br>
But she said he knew,
<br>
Two years earlier his end , he could view
<br>
All the pain , he silently hid, with that smile and charm,
<br>
His face reflected that he was at peace and forever calm.
<br>
The house was as silent as it could have ever been .
<br>
She mourned and wept at places where she couldn’t be seen.
<br>
She cried and cried till her eyes were deep red.
<br>
when she closed her eyes ,all she could see was him lying on that bed.
<br><br> 
You see how her smile fades away..
<br>
And she seems to have lost all ways..
<br>
Oh almighty her strength you have to increase!
<br>
May his soul rest in peace
<br>
But only if all of this is true,
<br>
because the reality is that all her life is now blue.
<br><br>
The bond was not that of a grandfather and his granddaughter,
<br>
But simply of a father and his daughter.
<br>
She resided in his heart as he said,
<br>
 held her hand tight even when on bed.
<br>
Oh supreme being think of that girl and the bond that they shared!
<br>
For him, she really cared, 
<br>
and so did he..

See that girl, that girl is me.
<br><br>
He was a fighter for sure
<br>
,but his problems why couldn’t he cure??
<br>
Will she still have to move on in life?
<br>
With her heart broken into pieces ,as if cut with a knife.
<br>
Pieces so small, impossible to be put back to place,
<br>
Can all of this not be seen by looking at her face?
<br>
Purest of the pure souls he was..
<br>
For her, he was just perfect ,without any flaws.
<br>
And they say , what he deserved , he did attain.
<br>
As he entered a world where there was no loss and no gain.
<br><br>
She still feels he is here and hasn’t gone away,
<br>
but then why does he not make her feel his presence in any way??
<br>
She feels he is reading and so she writes..
<br>
And in his memory daily recites.
<br>
For him to listen and come to her soon,
<br>
for she feels alone and deprived of that cocoon
<br>
When they clap for her in praise,
<br>
she closes her eyes and wishes if she could go back to those days,
<br>
when she ran to him and shared all that happened during the day.
<br>
And he listened with full energy and zeal to what she had to say.
<br>
But now, he wont listen to her voice and his energetic face , she will not be able to see
<br>
It is not the same and will never be…
