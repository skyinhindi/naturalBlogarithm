(This poem is about a girl who lives in a town - Carolanti, where it is a sin to sing. But when she falls in love with a man of words, 
she begins to sing her interpretation of what he writes. But when her beloved fails to reciprocate her love, she gives up on 
all human emotions. Though a change of events calls her back to her purpose in this world, which was to sing. Henceforth, 
she begins a rebellion which was long needed in this town of Carolanti.
 Though her end is probably not the perfect one you are hoping for, its worth giving a shot!)</b>
   <br><br>
   <p>Behind the fumes of the hard pressed city
veiled is a girl, untouched by worldly norms
still raw, unprocessed
into the city’s walking dead
even in times, when man turns into a utensil
she is uncannily sensitive
her actions, ideas, she herself as a whole
is known to be serene, pacific as the moon
she has never been beyond the pale
or maybe, I just spoke too soon
<br>
The poised girl, known to be living in a cocoon
with heavy steps, is breaking the taboo
in the burgh she lives, it is a sin to chant
but regardless of the law inscribed in the charter
salvation she seeks by singling to her own command
her defiance takes the townsmen by surprise 
whenever she sets foot in their realm
panic stricken, the doors on their shanties snap shut
and ears shielded by their palms.
a tradition that dates back so long, unforeseen
is challenged by a lass in a trice
and all the fearful pretending to be oblivious
turn a deaf ear to the blameless youth’s uprise
I know you would say its bizarre
but times then, were not as they are.
<br>
But how did a girl as righteous as herself
managed to be looked down upon as an insurgent, a rebel?
some things are just hard to explain 
but I’ll try my best to do the same
she lives in a city known to all as Carolanti
but as charming as the name sounds 
as trivial, shallow and empty it is
don’t take me wrong
it is as deep-pocketed and established as one could hope to be
in fact that’s what slaughtered its instilled humanity
don’t mistake it for an ordinary town of your modern day
its Carol-anti, where music itself refuses to play!
<br>
Centuries ago, there was a king
well, if truth be told
a tyrant, a dictator more suitably
his ambition sucked all the sensation he held
he transformed from man to stone
his kingdom was a curse to be lived on
his wrath was a bull which could never be shoved off
for those who peruse through this tale, do ponder
the more knowledge you have, the more power you seek
the lesser the human you tend to be.
<br>
In his reign, indeed the town prospered
but at the cost of the solace of his people
yet no one dared to raise his voice against the brutish being
‘cause after all, he was the king!
even in hushed voices when they would talk
always lingered on the fear of being heard or caught
but there was one who was sick of the abuse
his vision was blur because of the tears in his eyes
but still he could make out the scars on his son’s flesh
and he began singing his grievances for the best
<br>
It was stunning, the effect his rough notes could have
his song soon became an anthem every man would chant
he was a spark who lit a fire
he emancipated all to reach for their heart’s desire
music liberated all from their misery
the melody reignited their spirits 
and lyrics challenged their pluck
and what was to come ahead
left their emperor thunderstruck!
<br>
The atmosphere began to stir
the submissive man aspired to soar
with this medium of music, he would march up to the king’s door
the crowd could see a trickle of fear in their ruler’s eyes
though, it didn’t last for long and he got his nerve back
no mercy did he show to his own people
and lashed his troops on the protesters.
it was absurd how quickly the crowd went shut
probably because the tyrant terminated all for their foolish gut
and since then no one has sung
in this town of Carol-Anti
all the damage had already been done
ironically, the land where music was born
he eradicated it, as if it were plague.
<br>
And now, decades later, streets have again managed to sway to the beat
when she sings, in terror, all hide away
because of lores they’ve heard, claiming music destroys.
but I pity them for they’ll never know
what all a simple note can do
this cohort has never even heard
and unfortunately, neither will it anytime soon
‘cause mothers lock their agog sons in
whenever she walks within their range
but how long can curiosity be constrained?
Soon enough a lad will listen!
<br>
You’d say that in a city like this
how could a girl as plain as her
learn to sing when she has never even heard a lullaby?
Love can make you do strange things my friend
in love, breaking the rules, in fact
is not even the biggest threat.
<br>
A few months ago, on a cold stormy night
while returning to the place she once called her home
returning to the people who she once called her own
who have now disowned her for her unlikely might
who, if asked, would refuse to recognize her tonight
save the shock, for it’s a miracle she wasn’t hung
belike, they wanted to see the end of what she had begun
that eerily silent night, she lost her way
into the woods, where she didn’t intend to stay.
But the darkness sucked her in like quicksand
it was as if it was conspired
for her to walk into the no man’s land.
<br>
Golden beams hit her eyes
she raced to the source without thinking twice.
there sat a boy, lost I thought
pouring out is heart to the blank of a page
his wet eyes seemed to have seen a lot
his iris was a shade of grey
which she just couldn’t pretend to ignore
he was the most magnificent being she had seen
and that’s where love intervened…..
For hours he wrote, 
and she sat out of his gaze
I know not why she stood so still
while he walked away, leaving the piece of paper behind him.
She crept up to the page he was working on
and read it all night long.
Her interpretation of what he wrote
woke up a side of her she had never even known
he was a man of words
and as his words sunk in
she began to sing!
<br>
She didn’t expect much
maybe nothing at all
perhaps that’s what scared her
because then at her it dawned
the solemnity of it all
it was never just naive infatuation
and probably, she knew that all along
but how could a girl at fourteen
feel something so strong?
<br>
A storm had overcome the tranquility of her soul
she felt at sea with her new found endearment
it was beyond lucid desire or lust
but apparently that was what she dreaded
because it was simpler to get over a mania, a fancy
than what she felt presently
she couldn’t help but give way to that insanity
though she knew better than falling for him
‘cause after all everything that falls, breaks….
<br>
She knew that the notes that came out of her mouth
would never be accepted by the crowd
but what she felt now
there was no better way to express it somehow.
All she wanted was the man she loved to listen,
to reciprocate the love she had given
she heard feet scramble every time she came near
but that never bothered her
never did her devotion tremble
<br>
Soon she came to terms with what she felt
and decided to confess her ardour to the lad.
Again she walked down the moor, into the woods
in hope of seeing him where that day he stood
at dusk when she saw him there,
she released a breath shed been holding way too long
and sung out to him,
words she never had the nerve to say.
Unlike the others he didn’t run away,
he didn’t shut his ears, not a word did he say.
just the look that he gave  said it all
a look of disgust, contempt and anger all together
a look that she should’ve known she would get
she should’ve known that he was just like the rest
the piercing look of his eyes damaged her to an extent 
that she had lost all desire to ever sing again….
<br>
And since then she hasn’t sung a word
in the last three weeks and four days
she has cut herself from the rest of the world
she has parted herself from all emotion
she is no more human, just flesh and bone.
And even though she doesn’t sing anymore
no one dares to creep near her door
and unfortunately, she likes it that way
in this insensitive world, she has no intention to stay.
For those who peruse through this tale, do ponder
death is not the greatest loss in life
it is what dies inside of us while we live!
<br>
But probably it was destiny 
for music called her back to its doom
to undo its extinction.
one day, a young lad, who barely reached her thigh
tried to peep through the broken window of her shed
probably to have a look of the girl
whose name was now a metonym for destruction
that was the first living being she had seen in a month and two days
she just couldn’t help herself and let him in.
in turn he just stared at her,
the edge of his lip curled
his delicate arms were in her bony hands
there were tears in her eyes when he sang
I know not how he heard her sing
but I told you curiosity could never be constrained!
<br>
He stood on his toes and put his arms around her,
barely reaching her waist
while she happily sung the harmony to his lyrics
that’s when she knew that she’d rather hurt than feel nothing at all
for she was meant to sing no matter what the others thought
her fear of pain had deprived her from all that could cause it.
She was living her living her life in a blind pit
but now she knew better.
For those who peruse through this tale, do ponder
the fear of suffering is worse
than suffering itself….
<br>
Though her fragile fingers no more were their beautiful self,
her soul was much more divine and stronger than it had ever been.
her purpose on this land was reunite humanity with man and music with lyrics
all alone she ventured back to the town
but this time she wasn’t alone
for she has the young lad accompanying her sound
but this time something seemed so much more different
for this time her motive wasn’t to express her affection
but to reach out to those 
who were terrified of what came out of her mouth
inspired by the young lad, more youths joined the choir
<br>
And this time there was nothing that their nurturers could do
their zeal and curiosity could no more be locked in
and all followed the girl to the journey to the king
the king though, did not hassle at all
he knew that the girl was the fuel to the fire
all he had to do was eliminate her from this meagre rebellion
and no more would it remain one.
so he did, when she reached his fortress
she was thrown into the prison and again absurdly silent went the rest
but this silence wasn’t of death but of fear
and it killed her inside for she had failed her pursuit.
<br>
She had confidence in her people
and now she wished she didn’t
for their fear of being imprisoned,
they failed to realise that they already were
and now all she craved was a respectable decease
she hadn’t had a grain of food or a drop of water in three days
her departure from life was not far away
that’s when she heard a song
her song, her melody, her lyrics
reverberated in the dark dungeon
her tired eyes widened
and with all the energy that she could muster
she walked up to the sole barred sudden light blinded her vision
but in a second or two she could see a thousand figures walking up to the fort
man, children, wives, all!
Marched down and sang her song
sleep deprived with her dry throat
she managed to join the crowd
tears ran down her inexistent cheeks
but this time they weren’t of horror, pain or fear
instead of the bliss of victor
of which she was the pioneer and with a triumphant, content smile
she bid adieu to this world
to walk up to the stairway of heaven she deserved.
For those who peruse through this tale, do ponder
nothing safe is worth the drive
so anything that gets your blood racing
is worth doing!
<br>
For those who peruse through this tale, do ponder
people with great passion
can make the impossible happen!
